    <h2>Make 2d games the node.js way.</h3>
    <h4>crtrdg uses browserify to make awesome 2d games.</h4>

    <h3>Existing crtrdg modules:</h3>
    <p>crtrdg takes a very modular approach to javascript games, and does so with the help of tools like <a href="http://github.com/browserify" target="_blank">browserify</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Check out our existing crtrdg modules:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-gameloop" target="_blank">crtrdg-gameloop</a> - the main gameloop / ticker module.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-entity" target="_blank">crtrdg-entity</a> - for entities in the game.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-keyboard" target="_blank">crtrdg-keyboard</a> - for keyboard interaction.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-mouse" target="_blank">crtrdg-mouse</a> - for mouse interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purpose of crtrdg:</h3>
    <p>Almost every javascript game / animation library I've found bundles things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.</p>

    <p>So what if each element of 2d games were broken up into it's own modules / repositories?</p>

    <p>With inspiration from <a href="http://voxeljs.com" target="_blank">voxel.js</a>, crtrdg is a collection of javascript modules used for developing 2d games.</p>

    <p>As I learned more about node.js, the core events module, and browserify, I realized the ideal api for making simple 2d games could be based on node's events module. So you'll see a lot of crtrdg modules exposing an api that includes .on('some event', function(){}), which seems to make a lot of sense for games.</p>
