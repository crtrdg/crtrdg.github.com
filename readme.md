## Purpose of `crtrdg`:
Almost every javascript game / animation library I've found bundles things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.

So what if each element of 2d games were broken up into it's own modules / repositories?

With inspiration from voxel.js, crtrdg is a collection of javascript modules used for developing 2d games.

As I learned more about node.js, the core events module, and browserify, I realized the ideal api for making simple 2d games could be based on node's events module. So you'll see a lot of crtrdg modules exposing an api that includes `.on('some event', function(){})`, which seems to make a lot of sense for games.
